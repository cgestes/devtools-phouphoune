Code signing:
Create a certifate using http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html. Stop when it start talking about plists files. Call the certificate "iPhone Developer".

edit: (not required in think)
Next, you need to edit /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS3.0.sdk/SDKSettings.plist and change CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED from YES to NO.

/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Info.plist
find line 46 and replace "XCiPhoneOSCodeSignContext" with "XCCodeSignContext" (see image). Repeat the operation for line 79 and save the file.
